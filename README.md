After nearly 20 years of using Linux on the desktop, I would like to structure my knowledge of the system.

The main goals of my "100 days of Linux" challenge are:

- completing the courses and books I bought some time ago (on Linux, Docker and the DevOps approach)

- better knowledge of networking and TCP/IP issues

- looking at SQL databases from the administrator's side
