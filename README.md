After nearly 20 years of using Linux on the desktop, I would like to structure my knowledge of the system.

The main goals of my "100 days of Linux" challenge are:

- completing the courses and books I bought some time ago (on Linux / Docker / the DevOps approach)

- better knowledge of networking and TCP/IP issues

- looking at SQL databases from the administrator's perspective

- Hardware upgrades - I replaced broken laptop display with a new one and upgraded the RAM (8 -> 16 GiB).

- I read actively (= did all quizzes / hands-on exercises from) the first 3 chapters from the excelent Vim tutorial [Mastering Vim Quickly](https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/).

- I read actively one chapter about Linux installation from my [RHCSA](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide/) book.

- I upgraded my default VirtualBox sandbox with Red Hat 9, installed Alma Linux 9 on another virtual machine. 

New #Anki flashcards: 17

(Update: flashcards imported from Logseq look terrible - I'm going to write own export tool in Python).

### &#128994; 2023-10-17 Day 02

- I read actively the next chapter **Using essential tools** from my RHCSA book (without the last exercise!) about working with shell, man pages and basic Vim commands.
